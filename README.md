# Is the 7 Train Running

### Know before you go!
This is a recreation of a web app (https://www.isthelrunning.com/) that I used all the time when I lived on the L line that just told you if the L train is running.

No fuss, no muss.

Now that I live on the 7 line, I decided to recreate it for my current commute.
